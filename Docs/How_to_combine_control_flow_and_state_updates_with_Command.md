# How to combine control flow and state updates with Command¶

Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

* State
* Nodes
* Edges
* Command

This functionality also requires @langchain/langgraph>=0.2.29.

It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:

```
const myNode = (state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => { return new Command({ // state update update: { foo: "bar", }, // control flow goto: "myOtherNode", }); };
```

If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph: Command.PARENT in Command:

```
const myNode = (state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => { return new Command({ update: { foo: "bar" }, goto: "other_subgraph", // where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph graph: Command.PARENT, }); };
```

This guide shows how you can use Command to add dynamic control flow in your LangGraph app.

## Setup¶

First, let's install the required packages:

```
yarn add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

Let's create a simple graph with 3 nodes: A, B and C. We will first execute node A, and then decide whether to go to Node B or Node C next based on the output of node A.

## Define graph¶

```
import { Annotation, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph"; // Define graph state const StateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({ foo: Annotation<string>, }); // Define the nodes const nodeA = async (_state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => { console.log("Called A"); // this is a replacement for a real conditional edge function const goto = Math.random() > .5 ? "nodeB" : "nodeC"; // note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node return new Command({ // this is the state update update: { foo: "a", }, // this is a replacement for an edge goto, }); }; // Nodes B and C are unchanged const nodeB = async (state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => { console.log("Called B"); return { foo: state.foo + "|b", }; } const nodeC = async (state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => { console.log("Called C"); return { foo: state.foo + "|c", }; }
```

We can now create the StateGraph with the above nodes. Notice that the graph doesn't have conditional edges for routing! This is because control flow is defined with Command inside nodeA.

```
import { StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph"; // NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C! const graph = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation) .addNode("nodeA", nodeA, { ends: ["nodeB", "nodeC"], }) .addNode("nodeB", nodeB) .addNode("nodeC", nodeC) .addEdge("__start__", "nodeA") .compile();
```

Important

You might have noticed that we add an ends field as an extra param to the node where we use Command. This is necessary for graph compilation and validation, and tells LangGraph that nodeA can navigate to nodeB and nodeC.

```
import * as tslab from "tslab"; const drawableGraph = await graph.getGraphAsync(); const image = await drawableGraph.drawMermaidPng(); const arrayBuffer = await image.arrayBuffer(); await tslab.display.png(new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer));
```

If we run the graph multiple times, we'd see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.

```
await graph.invoke({ foo: "" });
```

```
Called A Called B { foo: 'a|b' }
```

## Navigating to a node in a parent graph¶

Now let's demonstrate how you can navigate from inside a subgraph to a different node in a parent graph. We'll do so by changing node\_a in the above example into a single-node graph that we'll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.

```
// Define the nodes const nodeASubgraph = async (_state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => { console.log("Called A"); // this is a replacement for a real conditional edge function const goto = Math.random() > .5 ? "nodeB" : "nodeC"; // note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node return new Command({ update: { foo: "a", }, goto, // this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph // NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph graph: Command.PARENT, }); }; const subgraph = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation) .addNode("nodeA", nodeASubgraph) .addEdge("__start__", "nodeA") .compile(); const parentGraph=

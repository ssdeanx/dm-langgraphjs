# How to add memory to the prebuilt ReAct agent

This tutorial will show how to add memory to the prebuilt ReAct agent. Please see this tutorial for how to get started with the prebuilt ReAct agent

All we need to do to enable memory is pass in a checkpointer to createReactAgent

## Setup

First, we need to install the required packages.

```
yarn add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

This guide will use OpenAI's GPT-4o model. We will optionally set our API key for LangSmith tracing, which will give us best-in-class observability.

```
// process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk_..."; // Optional, add tracing in LangSmith // process.env.LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = "ls__..." // process.env.LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND = "true"; process.env.LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND = "true"; process.env.LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 = "true"; process.env.LANGCHAIN_PROJECT = "ReAct Agent with memory: LangGraphJS";
```

```
ReAct Agent with memory: LangGraphJS
```

## Code

Now we can use the prebuilt createReactAgent function to setup our agent with memory:

```
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai"; import { tool } from '@langchain/core/tools'; import { z } from 'zod'; import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt"; import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph"; const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o", }); const getWeather = tool((input) => { if (input.location === 'sf') { return 'It\'s always sunny in sf'; } else { return 'It might be cloudy in nyc'; } }, { name: 'get_weather', description: 'Call to get the current weather.', schema: z.object({ location: z.enum(['sf','nyc']).describe("Location to get the weather for."), }) }) // Here we only save in-memory const memory = new MemorySaver(); const agent = createReactAgent({ llm: model, tools: [getWeather], checkpointSaver: memory });
```

## Usage

Let's interact with it multiple times to show that it can remember prior information

```
let inputs = { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what is the weather in NYC?" }] }; let config = { configurable: { thread_id: "1" } }; let stream = await agent.stream(inputs, { ...config, streamMode: "values", }); for await ( const { messages } of stream ) { let msg = messages[messages?.length - 1]; if (msg?.content) { console.log(msg.content); } else if (msg?.tool_calls?.length > 0) { console.log(msg.tool_calls); } else { console.log(msg); } console.log("-----\n"); }
```

```
what is the weather in NYC? ----- [ { name: 'get_weather', args: { location: 'nyc' }, type: 'tool_call', id: 'call_m0zEI6sidPPH81G6ygMsKYs1' } ] ----- It might be cloudy in nyc ----- The weather in NYC appears to be cloudy. -----
```

Notice that when we pass the same thread ID, the chat history is preserved

```
inputs = { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's it known for?" }] }; stream = await agent.stream(inputs, { ...config, streamMode: "values", }); for await ( const { messages } of stream ) { let msg = messages[messages?.length - 1]; if (msg?.content) { console.log(msg.content); } else if (msg?.tool_calls?.length > 0) { console.log(msg.tool_calls); } else { console.log(msg); } console.log("-----\n"); }
```

```
